Hello! I am currently undergoing my Master's in CS at Saarland University while working as a Research Assistant at Max Planck Institute for Informatics.
 Starting my B.S thesis in 2018, my main interest has become in NLP applications and research. I can be classified with high confidence as a
coffeeholic Ambievert who loves to talk about comedy, travel, politics, and philosophy.
