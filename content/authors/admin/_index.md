I am an Applied Scientist Intern in the Goldman Sachs AI team and an Incoming Intern in Allen AI. I will be finishing my Masters in Computer Science at Saarland University this Fall.

Before Goldman Sachs I was a Research Assistant at Max Planck Institute where my research was focused on Integrating common-sense knowledge to Pre-trained models like BERT. I have encountered multipe roles before that all focused on Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. 

I can be classified with high confidence as a coffeeholic Ambievert who loves to talk about comedy, travel, politics, and philosophy.
