abstract: Research in NLP lacks geographic diversity, and the question of how NLP can
be scaled to low-resourced languages has
not yet been adequately solved. “Lowresourced”-ness is a complex problem going beyond data availability and reflects
systemic problems in society.
In this paper, we focus on the task of Machine Translation (MT), that plays a crucial role for information accessibility and
communication worldwide. Despite immense improvements in MT over the past
decade, MT is centered around a few highresourced languages.

As MT researchers cannot solve the problem of low-resourcedness alone, we propose participatory research as a means to
involve all necessary agents required in
the MT development process. We demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of participatory research with a case study on
MT for African languages. Its implementation leads to a collection of novel
translation datasets, MT benchmarks for
over 30 languages, with human evaluations for a third of them, and enables participants without formal training to make
a unique scientific contribution. Benchmarks, models, data, code, and evaluation
results are released at https://github.
com/masakhane-io/masakhane-mt.
